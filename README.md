# hello-world

Hi there!

My name is Aaron, and I'm a physicst that is currently transitioning into the world of data science. I have a specifically keen interest 
in machine learning, and I'm currently working in an experiemental physics laboratory, implementing a convolutional neural network to 
analyze the mechanical response of amorphous (non-homogenous) systems under an applied force. We'll get into more details on this as
my reseach progresses. Stay tuned...
