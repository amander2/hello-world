# hello-world

Hi there!

My name is Aaron, and I'm an experimental physicist that is currently transitioning into the world of data science and computer programming. I have a specifically keen interest (like many) in machine learning, and I'm currently working on two projects, one is to implement convolutional neural networking (CNN) techniques to analyze the mechanical response of amorphous (non-homogenous) systems under an applied force, the other is to apply a combination of CNN and regression frameworks to analyze the force applied to a glacier terminus from the velocity field created by the motion of an ice m√©lange under oscillatory tidal forces.

All of my current work is being completed in Python, using TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn as a backend for my deep learning function libraries. As I move through the process, my goal is to become more confident in my programming skills, and to become more knowledgeable in the areas of databasing, and web app functionality.

In addition to these scientific projects, I have also co-founded two software startups. The goal of each is unique, and more information will be placed here in future updates to my profile and GitHub repos.

Thanks for taking the time to look. Any and all suggestions are welcomed.
